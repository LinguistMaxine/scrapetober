## Session 1
Andrew Collier, Exegetics Analytics

Link to github page -  http://bit.ly/rladies-scraping

Notes:
* webscraping is about getting information from URLs automatically (automagically)
* Use an API if it is there. 
* If no API, then scrape the page.
+ there are some services you can use who scrape the web, but these are not always free, and you don't have acces to the code

webpage content has two types - static content from server to browser; AND dynamic content generated by javascript in the browser

Languages needed:
HTML - yes; e.g. tags
CSS - limited amount; e.g. selectors
Javascript - no
